The design wiki is meant to hold design documentation.

# Writing effective designs
Designs should be written in Markdown (supports syntax highlight) or AsciiDoc (use external syntax highlighter such as [gist] (https://gist.github.com) until github [fixes](https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/280) the highlighting).

# What to include
Try and make sure your design docs have references to JIRAs, as well as versions affected and target versions.

# Images and diagrams
Pictures speak a thousand words.  Use [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) to draw and host your images, and link to them from here.
